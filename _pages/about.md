I work at <a href='http://research.google.com'>Google Research</a>. 

My research interests are Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AI/ML), and AI for Science / Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), with a specific application focus on AI for Weather and Climate Science.  At Google Research, I lead a team of scientists and engineers, working in those directions. 

I was a Professor of Computer Science at University of Southern California (USC). I no longer provide research assistantships, postdoc or internship positions there. So please do <b>not</b> inquire those opportunities with me.

I do respond to service requests to the research communities, though my bandwidth is limited.
