I am a research scientist at <a href='http://research.google.com'>Google Research</a>. 

My research interests are Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AI/ML), and AI for Science / Scientific Machine Learning (SciML).  At Google Research, I lead a team of scientists and engineers, working in those directions. 

I was a Professor of Computer Science at University of Southern California (USC). I no longer offer research assistantships, postdoc or internship positions there. So please do <b>not</b> inquire those opportunities with me.

I do respond to service requests from research communities, including writing reference letters, serving on (grant) panels and editorial boards, organizing conferences. My bandwidth is limited so I apologize in advance if your request is not responded promptly.
