I am a Research Scientist at Google Research. 

My research interests are Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML), and AI for Science/Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), with a specific application focus on AI for Weather and Climate Science.  At Google Research, I lead a team of scientists and engineers, working in those directions. 

Previously, I was a Professor of Computer Science at University of Southern California (USC). I no longer admit students and postdocs there. So please do not inquire those opportunities with me.
