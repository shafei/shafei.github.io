<h3>History</h3>
<br>

Prior to 2013, we were a small research group, <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20130114083512/http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~feisha/'>http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~feisha</a>.

I worked at UCLA for one year, setting up a lab <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20161128002341/http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~feisha/'>http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~feisha/</a>.


After returning to USC, we grew from a small lab <a href='http://teds-usc.github.io'>teds.usc.edu</a>,  into a sizable one <a href='http://sha-lab.github.io'>shalab.usc.edu</a>. 

In Spring 2023, we graduated the last PhD student <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=R7wXId8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate'>Michiel de Jong</a>.
