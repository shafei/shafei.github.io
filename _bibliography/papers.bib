  abstract    = "Because histologic types are subjective and difficult to
                 reproduce between pathologists, tissue morphology often takes
                 a back seat to molecular testing for the selection of breast
                 cancer treatments. This work explores whether a deep-learning
                 algorithm can learn objective histologic H\&E features that
                 predict the clinical subtypes of breast cancer, as assessed by
                 immunostaining for estrogen, progesterone, and Her2 receptors
                 (ER/PR/Her2). Translating deep learning to this and related
                 problems in histopathology presents a challenge due to the
                 lack of large, well-annotated data sets, which are typically
                 required for the algorithms to learn statistically significant
                 discriminatory patterns. To overcome this limitation, we
                 introduce the concept of ``tissue fingerprints,'' which
                 leverages large, unannotated datasets in a label-free manner
                 to learn H\&E features that can distinguish one patient from
                 another. The hypothesis is that training the algorithm to
                 learn the morphological differences between patients will
                 implicitly teach it about the biologic variation between them.
                 Following this training internship, we used the features the
                 network learned, which we call ``fingerprints,'' to predict
                 ER, PR, and Her2 status in two datasets. Despite the discovery
                 dataset being relatively small by the standards of the machine
                 learning community (n = 939), fingerprints enabled the
                 determination of ER, PR, and Her2 status from whole slide H\&E
                 images with 0.89 AUC (ER), 0.81 AUC (PR), and 0.79 AUC (Her2)
                 on a large, independent test set (n = 2531). Tissue
                 fingerprints are concise but meaningful histopathologic image
                 representations that capture biological information and may
                 enable machine learning algorithms that go beyond the
                 traditional ER/PR/Her2 clinical groupings by directly
                 predicting theragnosis.",
